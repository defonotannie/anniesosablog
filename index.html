                    On the Internet you can find a lot of problems, hackers, scammers, ped*philes, illegal web pages, copy right, etc... Anyone can fall into these traps and screw up, so here are some tips to avoid these problems. <br>
                    •	let's be honest, hackers are everywhere, if you don't want to be one of their "victims", make sure you use long and complex passwords, DO NOT ACCEPT COOKIES EVERYWHERE!!! you don't know what kind of virus can have the page you use, so always make sure there is a padlock at the top of the browser and that they are national and/or international pages. <br>
                    •	scammers, not only people but the apps as well, make sure that wherever you are going to pay, it is a reliable app with good reviews and enough downloads. Not only that, do not put your credit card in the app, when you make the payment, remove it immediately from your payment methods, it is not safe to leave all your information there. <br>
                    •	If you are an adult trying to help your child avoid the dangers of the Internet, I recommend downloading the following 100% free parental access apps. <br>
                    - Qustudio <br>
                    - Family Link <br>
                    - Norton <br>
                    - Bark <br>
                    - Famisafe <br>
                    •	Stay safe from illegal websites and their viruses by using a VPN on your electronic device. VPNs allow you to unblock websites, protect your online privacy and stay secure on public Wi-Fi networks. <br>
                    •	before making copyright think about it first, read web page untop to be informed of the legal consequences.

                <h3>
                    Some of the ethical issues on internet are: <br>
                    • Misuse of personal data <br>
                    • Spread of misinformation <br>
                    • Artificial inteligence (AI) <br>
                    • Implementations issues <br>
                    • Intelectual property <br>
                    Try not to let your personal data and stuff when talking about unrecognized web pages, try to use your own words if you are publishing something online <br>
                    and evade sending pictures to online people and those who you dont know.
